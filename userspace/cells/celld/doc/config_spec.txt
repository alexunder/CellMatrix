Cell configuration files are stored in the ".cellconf" directory, which resides
in the container directory.
(".cellconf" is defined as CONFIG_DIR in cell_config.h)

Config files are named as the cell name appended with ".conf" Ex: If the name
of a cell is "cell_a", the config file will be named "cell_a.conf"

Config files consist of a series of keys and values. With one key/value
pair per line, separated by a space.

Keys:
-----
startopts
	The start options used when starting a cell. Immediately after
	creation (before a cell has started) this will be set to the
	default options. After the cell has been started, it will be
	set to whatever the last options used were.
	These options are used when starting the cell unless specified
	otherwise.

autostart
	"1" to automatically start the cell when celld starts, "0" not to.

initpid
	The pid of the cell's init process. This is used when "re-attaching"
	to cells after celld has restarted.
